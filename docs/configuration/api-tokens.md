# API Tokens

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using API Tokens is highly **recommended**, but not mandatory.
> Some important Security Features won't be available (like default Blocked Endpoints).

Defined API Tokens for accessing **Secured Signal API** endpoints.

```yaml
api:
  tokens: [token1, token2, token3]
```

> [!NOTE]
> Blocked Endpoints can be reactivated by manually configuring them
