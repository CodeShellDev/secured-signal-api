# API Tokens

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using API tokens is highly **recommended**, but not mandatory.
> Some important Security Features won't be available (for example the default [blocked endpoints](./endpoints#default))

Defined API tokens for accessing **Secured Signal API** endpoints.

```yaml
api:
  tokens: [token1, token2, token3]
```

> [!TIP]
> Blocked endpoints can be reactivated by manually configuring them
